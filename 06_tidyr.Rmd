## 4.4 `tidyr`: Tidy Messy Data

`tidyr` provides several functions that help you to bring your data into *tidy data* format (cf. [tidy data](#tidy data)).

Let's again start with our `penguins` data set which already is in tidy format:
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  head(6)
```

**Dimensionality:** [`r dim(penguins)`]

???
- in the following i highlight the dimensionality of the data to show you what happens

## 4.4 `tidyr`: Tidy Messy Data

**Pivotting:** Converts between long and wide format using `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`:
```{r}
non_tidy_penguins <- penguins %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm),
    names_to = "variable", values_to = "measurement"
  )

non_tidy_penguins %>%
  head(6)
```

**Dimensionality:** [`r dim(non_tidy_penguins)`]

???
- now for each observation we have three rows, one row per measurement of each of the varibales which are measured in millimeters -> no tidy format any longer
- with `pivot_wider()` we can basically invert this operation

name: tidyr_nest

## 4.4 `tidyr`: Tidy Messy Data

**Nesting:** Groups similar data such that each group becomes a single row in a data frame (the structure is then referred to as a *nested data frame*).

```{r}
nested_penguins <- penguins %>% 
  nest(
    nested_data = c(island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex)
  )
```
.pull-left[
```{r, echo=F}
nested_penguins
```

**Dimensionality:** [`r dim(nested_penguins)`]
]
.pull-right[
Note that
- `nest()` produces a nested data frame with one row per species and year,
- the `nested_data` column contains `tibbles` with six columns each and a varying amount of observations,
- individual `tibbles` from the `nested_data` column can be accessed using `dpylr::pull()`,
- nesting can be reverted via `unnest()`.
]

???
- the work with nested data can be particularly helpful if you would like to apply functions to each subset of the data (e.g., fit a model for each year or for each species)

## 4.4 `tidyr`: Tidy Messy Data

**Rectangling:** Disentangles nested data structures (e.g., JSON, HTML) and brings it into tidy format (see `unnest()`, `unnest_longer()` and `unnest_wider()`).

**Splitting** an **Combining:** Transforms a single character column into multiple columns and vice versa.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  unite(col = "species_gender", c(species, sex), sep = "_", remove = T) %>% 
  head(6)
```

Revert union using the `separate()` function. Alternatively, use `separate_rows()` if there are two observations for the same variable in one cell.

## Excursus: The RStudio "Help"-Pane

.center[
```{r, echo=F}
countdown::countdown(
  minutes = 2, seconds = 0, 
  left = 0, right = 0, top = 0.5, bottom = 0.5,
  padding = "50px",
  margin = "7.5%",
  font_size = "5em"
)
```
]

???
1. run help(unite) or ?unite or use pane itself for searching
2. see from which package the function stems (`{tidyr}`)
3. find a description, how to use the function, the arguments and their meaning, details of how it is implemented (e.g., `lm`), values (i.e. the output), examples, authors, references (where you can read more about the implemented method) 
4. talk about default values for arguments as well as positional and keyword arguments
5. search for "rectangling" to illustrate the integration of vignettes

## 4.4 `tidyr`: Tidy Messy Data

**Handling missing values:** `tidyr` also provides several function for handling `NA` data entries:
- by making implicit `NA` explicit using `complete()`,
- by making explicit `NA` implicit using `drop_na()`, or
- by replacing `NA` with the next/previous value (`fill()`) or a known value (`replace_na()`).

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=F}
incompl_penguins <- tibble(
  species = c(rep("Adelie", 2), rep("Gentoo", 1), rep("Chinstrap", 1)),
  year = c(2007, 2008, 2008, 2007),
  value = c(rnorm(3, mean = 50, sd = 15), NA)
)
```
```{r}
incompl_penguins
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
incompl_penguins %>% 
  complete(
    species, year, fill = list(value = NA)
  )
```
]

Note: function arguments preceded by a dot in the tidyverse may have one of two reasons:
- the function is still pre-mature, i.e. developers still think about the best way of implementing and naming the function
- the function is regularly applied within another function so that you don't confuse function arguments between the inner and outer function
