## `purrr`: Functional Programming Tools

`purrr` facilitates *functional programming* (FP) with data frame objects (e.g., `tibbles`) in `R`. Whenever you would normally refer to a `for`-loop for solving an iterative problem, the family of `map_*()` functions allows you to rephrase your problem as a data manipulation pipeline.

**Three types of `map_*()` function:**
- `map(.x, .f, ...)` takes the input `.x` and applies `.f` to each element in `.x`.
- `group_map(.data, .f, ...)` takes a grouped `tibble` and applies `.f` to each subgroup.
- `map2(.x, .y, .f, ...)` takes the inputs `.x` and `.y` and applies `.f` to `.x` and `.y` in parallel.
- `pmap(.l, .f, ...)` takes a list `.l` of inputs and applies `.f` to each element in `.l` in parallel.

.pull-left[
By default `map()` returns a list. If you want to be more explicit about the output you may refer to
- `map_lgl()` to receive an output type logical,
- `map_chr()` to receive an output type character,
- `map_int()` to receive an output type integer,
- `map_dbl()` to receive an output type double,
- `map_df()` to receive a data frame output.
]
.pull-right[
The input `.x` to any `map()_*` function can be either a vector, list or data frame.
- **Vector:** Iteration over vector entries
- **List:** Iteration over list elements
- **Data frame:** Iteration over columns

**Use Case:** Applying the z-normalization to multiple variables

First, write a *named function* for performing z-normalization that takes a vector `.x` as input.
```{r}
z_transform <- function(.x) {
  mean <- mean(.x); sd <- sd(.x); return( (.x - mean) / sd )
}
```

Second, draw samples from the `penguin` data set and store them as double vectors in a list.
```{r}
samples <- list(
  sample1 = slice_sample(penguins, n = 10)$bill_length_mm,
  sample2 = slice_sample(penguins, n = 10)$bill_depth_mm,
  sample3 = slice_sample(penguins, n = 10)$flipper_length_mm)
```
```{r, echo=F}
samples
```

???
here: different means and sd

**Use Case:** Applying the z-normalization to multiple variables

Third, perform the z-normalization using a `for`-loop.
```{r, eval=F}
for (s in samples) {
  print(z_transform(s))
}
```

Or simply perform the z-normalization using `map()`.
```{r}
map(.x = samples, .f = ~z_transform(.x)) #equivalent to map(samples, z_transform)
```

**Use Case:** Applying the z-normalization to multiple variables

Or perform the z-normalization using `map()` but use an *anonymous function*.
```{r, eval=F}
map(
  .x = samples,
  .f = function(.x) {
    (.x - mean(.x, na.rm = T)) / sd(.x, na.rm = T)
  })
```

Or perform the z-normalization using `map()` but use an *`purrr`-style function*.
```{r, eval=F}
map(
  .x = samples,
  .f = ~(.x - mean(.x, na.rm = T)) / sd(.x, na.rm = T))
```

This is great right?!?!
Now let us look at some other practical use cases!

Check the data types of my columns:
```{r}
penguins %>%
  map_df(class)
```
Check the number of missing values per column:
```{r}
penguins %>%
  map_df(~sum(is.na(.)))
```

Check the number of distinct values per column:
```{r}
penguins %>%
  map_df(n_distinct)
```

## `purrr`: Functional Programming Tools

Check the highest value in each subset of the data (e.g., largest `flipper_length_mm` per `sex`):
```{r}
penguins %>%
  drop_na %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>%
  group_map(~slice_max(., flipper_length_mm, n = 1), .keep = T)
```

???
drop_na: because otherwise I would also have a subgroup of NA

`map()` also comes in handy, if you like to produce a series of identical plots, each depicting a separate subset of the underlying data:
```{r, out.height='20%', out.width='20%'}
species <- penguins %>% distinct(species, year) %>% pull(species) #.x argument for map()
years <- penguins %>% distinct(species, year) %>% pull(year)      #.y argument for map()

penguin_plots <- map2(
  .x = species,
  .y = years,
  .f = ~{
    penguins %>%
      drop_na %>% 
      filter(species == .x, year == .y) %>% 
      ggplot() +
        geom_point(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
        labs(title = glue::glue("Scatter Plot Bill Length vs. BMI ({.x}, {.y})"))
    })
```

Finally, `map()` is really powerful in the context of modeling. In the following we fit a linear regression model for each `species`-`island` subset.

First, we create a nested data frame that contains a `tibble` of data for each `species`-`island` combination.
```{r}
nested_penguins <- penguins %>% 
  drop_na %>% 
  group_by(species, island) %>% 
  nest
```
```{r, echo=F}
nested_penguins
```

.pull-right[.footnote[
*Note: For accessing elements in a nested `tibble` you may use the `pluck()`. For example, for accessing the first `tibble` in the column `data`, you may run `nested_penguins %>% pluck("data", 1)`.*

Second, we fit a linear model to each data subset. In our model `body_mass_g` is regressed (`~`) on all other variables (denoted by a dot in the `lm()` formula).

```{r}
nested_penguins <- nested_penguins %>% 
  mutate(lin_reg = map(.x = data, .f = ~lm(body_mass_g ~ ., data = .x))) 
```
```{r, echo=F}
nested_penguins
```

Third, for each linear model, we generate a model summary using `summary()` and extract the model coefficients as a `tibble`. Finally, we use `unnest()` to receive a tidy data frame.

```{r, results=F}
nested_penguins %>% 
  mutate(coefs = map(lin_reg, ~summary(.x) %>% .$coefficients %>% as_tibble)) %>%
  select(-data, -lin_reg) %>% 
  unnest(coefs)
```
```{r, echo=F}
print(
  nested_penguins %>% 
    mutate(coefs = map(lin_reg, ~summary(.x) %>% .$coefficients %>% as_tibble)) %>%
    select(-data, -lin_reg) %>% 
    unnest(coefs),
  n = 4)
```

.footnote[
*Note: Here we eventually dropped the `lin_reg` and `data` columns, otherwise we would have carried around a lot of redundant data which may exceed our memory storage capacity very quickly.*
]

there are packages for automatically doing this with just one line of code, see `broom`
