# Introduction to the Tidyverse

This 2 hour workshop encompasses a comprehensive journey through the `tidyverse` ecosystem. It introduces important tools for working with rectangular data sets in `R` by showcasing a suite of packages which eases the prototype data science workflow in terms of data import, data cleaning, data transformation and data visualization.

More specifically, after this workshop the workshop participants will
- be familiar with the main tools of the Tidyverse and how it differs from base R,
- know their way around in working with the core packages of the Tidyverse for importing, tidying, transforming and visualizing data,
- be proficient in processing (non-tidy) data of any shape and quality,
- be able to produce high-quality, fully customizable visualizations,
- have improved their overall data literacy.


*The workshop is part of "Machine Learning in R" graduate course held at University of MÃ¼nster, School of Business and Economics in the winter term 2020/21.*
