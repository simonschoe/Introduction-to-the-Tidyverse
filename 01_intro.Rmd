Can also be seen as a philosophy of how to write code in R. Often when googling for specific solutions and reading the stackoverflow answers, you may find solutions which can be implemented using plain `base R` or using the `tidyverse` syntax.

**`Tidyverse` core packages:**
- `readr`: data import
- `tibble`: modern data frame object
- `stringr`: working with strings
- `forcats`: working with factors
- `tidyr`: data tidying
- `dplyr`: data manipulation
- `ggplot2`: data visualization
- `purrr`: functional programming

Tidyverse can be viewed as a meta-package
each package has its own goal which makes the tidyverse a modular collection of packages
these are the core packages (there are many others for special purposes which integrate seamlessly)
R data structures: atomic vector (character, integer, numeric, logical, complex), list, matrix, data frame, factors

Explain:
- see tidyverse package version as well as the version of the eight core packages
- the eight core packages are loaded by loading the `tidyverse` package
- note that some `base R` functions (`stats` namespace) are overwritten by their `tidyverse` equivalents (`dplyr` namespace)
- when working with a new or rarely used package, i prefer to explicitely state the namespace to remember where the function is coming from

These packages are geared towards facilitating the day-2-day data science workflow:

```
<br><br>
**Import:** `readr`  
**Tidy:** `tidyr`  
**Transform:** `dplyr`, `forcats`, `stringr`  
**Visualise:** `ggplot2`  
**Model:** `tidymodels`*  
**Communicate:** `rmarkdown`** 
**Program:** `magrittr`, `purrr`, `tibble`

This underlying design philosophy and grammar boils down to a consistent and easy-to-use API:

- The `tibble` as the core underlying data structure
- Extensive use of the `%>%`-operator for gluing together multiple function calls
- Consistently applied naming conventions (e.g., function names in *snakecase* [[Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/other-stats-artwork/coding_cases.png)])
- Consistent structuring of function arguments (e.g., `arg1 = data.frame, arg2 = col names, ...`)
- ...

The `tidyverse` syntax can be viewed as a "dialect" of `R`. When you have familiarized yourself with it, you will be able to easily transfer your knowledge about one function or package to other components of the `tidyverse`. Just like learning a new language.
