##`readr`: Read Rectangular Text Data

`readr` provides read functions for multiple different file formats:

- `read_delim()`: general delimited files
- `read_csv()`: comma separated files
- `read_tsv()`: tab separated files
- `read_fwf()`: fixed width files
- `read_table()`: white-space separated files
- `read_log()`: web log files

In addition, use the `readxl` package for Excel files or the `haven` package for Stata files.

.footnote[
*Note: In most European countries MS Excel is using `;` as the common delimiter, which can be important by simply switching to the `read_csv2()` function.*

???
`read_delim()` as a generalization of the other functions

##`readr`: Read Rectangular Text Data

Let's try it out by reading in some penguins data (note that the output of any `read_()` function is a `tibble` object.). For the purpose of illustrating the `readr` package the `penguins` data has been written to a csv-file.

```{r}
penguins <- readr::read_csv("./data/penguins.csv")
```

##`readr`: Read Rectangular Text Data

Note that `readr` prints the column specifications after importing. By default, `readr` tries to infer the column type (e.g., integer, numeric, character, factor, date, logical) from the first 1000 rows and parses the columns accordingly using the built-in `parse_()` functions.

- Try to make column specifications explicit! You likely get more familiar with your data and see warnings if something changes unexpectedly. 
```{r, eval=F}
readr::read_csv(
  "./data/penguins.csv",
    col_types = cols(
      species = col_character(),
      year = col_datetime(format = "%Y"),
      island = col_skip()
    )
  )
```

- Parsing only the first 1000 rows is efficient but can lead to erroneous guesses.  
```{r, eval=F}
readr::read_csv(file = "./data/penguins.csv", guess_max = 1001)
```
