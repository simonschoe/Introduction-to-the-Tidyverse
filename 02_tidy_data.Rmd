## The Concept of Tidy Data

> Tidy data sets are all alike; but every messy data set is messy in its own way.  
~ [Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)

.pull-left[
**Tidy Data Principles:** The concept of tidy data has been coined by Hadley Wickham in his 2014 paper "Tidy Data"[3]. The concept formulates principles for structuring rectangular, tabular data sets consisting of rows and columns:

1. Each variable is a column.

2. Each observation is a row.

3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

```{r, echo=F}
df_tidy <- tibble(
  person = c("John Smith", "Jane Doe", "Mary Johnson", "John Smith", "Jane Doe", "Mary Johnson"),
  treatment = c("a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "b"),
  result = c(NA, 16, 3, 2, 11, 1)
)

knitr::kable(df_tidy, format = "html")
```

3: relates to the storage of data set per table (analogy to principles in data base design)
consequently, the following tools and examples will be geared towards working with tabular data, not with text or image data

**Violations of the Tidy Data Principles:**
1. Column headers are values, not variable names.

2. Multiple variables are stored in one column.

3. Variables are stored in both rows and columns.

4. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.

5. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.

3: correlation matrix
4: table that contains sales data of customer and at the same time weather data
5: data from a 8-hours long randomized control trial scattered across eight different hourly tables
