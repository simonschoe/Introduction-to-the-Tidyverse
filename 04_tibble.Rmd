##`tibble`: Simple Data Frames

`tibble` provides an 'enhanced' data frame object of class `tbl_df`, a so-called *tibble*. *Tibbles* can be created in three different ways:
.pull-left[
Create *tibble* from column vectors with `tibble()`:
```{r, results=F}
tibble::tibble(
  x = c("a", "b"),
  y = c(1, 2),
  z = c(T, F)
)
```
Create *tibble* row by row with `tribble()`:
```{r, results=F}
tibble::tribble(
  ~x, ~y,  ~z,
  "a", 1,  T,
  "b", 2,  F
)
```
]
.pull-right[
Create *tibble* from existing data frames with `as_tibble()` and from named vectors with `enframe()`:
```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  x = c("a", "b"), y = c(1, 2), z = c(T, F)
)
```
```{r}
tibble::as_tibble(df)
```
]

##`tibble`: Simple Data Frames

There are three important differences between a `tibble` and a `data.frame` object:

**1) Printing:** `tibble()` prints only the first ten rows and all the columns that fit on the screen as well as a description of the data type.
```{r, echo=T}
penguins #adjust using print(tibble, n = 5) or options(tibble.print_max = 5)
```

##`tibble`: Simple Data Frames

There are three important differences between a `tibble` and a `data.frame` object:

**2) Subsetting:** Subsetting a `tibble` (`[]`) always returns another `tibble` and never a vector (in contrast to standard `data.frame` objects).
.pull-left[
```{r}
penguins[,"species"] %>%
  class
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  .[,"species"] %>% 
  class
```
]

**3) Partial Matching:** Subsetting with `tibbles` does not allow for partial matching, i.e. you must always provide the whole column name.

also an advantage of tibbles: Giving you better warning messages to confront you with problems early on.
